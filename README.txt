Math Monster
A math game for learning arithmitec at a first grade level.
What does it do?
MM allows a user to select difficulty levels 1-3.
It then builds a game of 10 questions, and presents the questions one at a time. Each question has a time limit and a visible counter which counts down from 10. Upon reaching 0, the game does some graphical version of an explosion, or other dire conclusion. On answering correctly or incorrectly (with time remaining) the game generates some user feedback.

Questions are built around the four basic operators +, -, * and /.
Difficulty is increased by increasing integer sizes, single, double or triple digit.

Difficulty   1                      2               3

*          2 * 8                 22 * 8           225 * 8
/          8 / 4                 8 / 4 | 4 / 8    22 / 4 
Level 1

MM further, returns a user score, and persists results to a file, with the date of the game, a user name, and a score

The game interface will be the command line. Game parameters will be entered as argument flags on the CL. Questions will be printed to the CL and responses as well. User will answer via CL.
How will a timer be implemented?
